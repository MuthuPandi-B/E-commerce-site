E-Commerce Store using Fake Store API
This project is a simple e-commerce application that fetches product data from the Fake Store API and displays it in a user-friendly interface. The application allows users to view a list of products, add them to a shopping cart, and manage the cart's contents, including increasing/decreasing item quantities and removing items. The total price is dynamically updated with a 10% discount applied.

React: Frontend JavaScript framework to manage UI and component-based development.
